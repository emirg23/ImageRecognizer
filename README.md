# ImageRecognizer

For better object detection results, the current yolo11s model can be replaced with a larger variant from https://huggingface.co/TheCluster/YOLOv11-CoreML, as the larger models are more trained and offer improved performance.


YOLOv11 is used for both static and real-time object detection.

MiDaS is used for static depth estimation.

ARKit is used for real-time depth estimation.
